# Project North Star : Hardware 

This folder contains the mechanical assets necessary to build a Project North Star AR Headset. Mechanical Release 3 bundles together all the lessons we learned into a new set of 3D files and drawings. It’s principle objective is to be more inviting, less hacked together, and more reliable. The design includes more adjustments and mechanisms for a larger variety of heads and facial geometries. Overall, the assembly is lighter, more balanced, and stiffer.

## ***WARNING:*** 

Work in Progress. This isn't a finished guide, nor end-user friendly. Major components are missing. Assembly requires care and patience. Nothing worth having is ever easy!


The 3D printed parts were designed around FDM 3D printers and eSun’s PLA+ filament. This filament is tougher and better resists cracking than regular PLA. Surface quality is good and large prints warp minimally, requiring lower temperatures than ABS. Finally, PLA+ is inexpensive and available on Amazon, so we hope that most people can procure the same or very similar material. 


The optics bracket can probably be made from a different process/material, but the headgear will require at least a thermoplastic to form the parts into their final shape. After printing the headgear parts, while the plastic is still warm (or re-heat them on the print bed), drape the part over a curved surface like a mannequin head. A few seconds later, the plastic cools enough to retain the curved shape. The end result is very strong while using very little plastic:

## Getting Started


The assembly drawing PDF in this repository illustrates each sub-assembly that makes up the headset. The headset has two main sub-assemblies that come together at the end: the optics bracket and the headgear, designated #100-000 and #200-000 respectively. To get started, collect the items in the Bill of Materials (BOM) and assemble the optics and headgear sub-assemblies as illustrated by the assembly drawing PDF.


Each part and sub-assembly in the project is given a part number. The first three digits of a part number designate the sub-assembly, while the last three are part identifiers. For example, part #120-002 belongs to a child sub-assembly of the optics bracket (#100-000) since it begins with a ‘1’ digit. The sub-assembly part #120-002 belongs to is #120-000. In the lower right corner of assembly drawing PDF’s page 6, we find the HALO ELECTRONICS MODULE ASSEMBLY which lists #120-002 as item 2 in the sub-assembly.
